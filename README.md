blackjack

The current code is a suggested implementation of bj

Some consideration

* There are comments in some classes to explain the implementation and other possible improvements

* Unit testing could be added with more time

* The implementation was done to consider serveral players as the normal game, the intention was to add this extra functionality

* For time, it could not be tested because the focus was to organize the code, the structure, the abstraction and modeling
of the business logic

* Some rules of the  game could be implemented differently with more time, as it was explained, but at least a base approach was developed
